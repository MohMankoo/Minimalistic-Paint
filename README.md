# Minimalistic-Paint

A minimalistic alternative to MS Paint built using Java. The project is centered around finding real-world applications of common design patterns such as Factory, Builder, Command, and Strategy. It also investigates Java's built-in GUI capabilities to render palatable graphics.

The project began in October 2017 with a team of 4 developers.
